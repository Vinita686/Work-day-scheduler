# Work-day-scheduler
Work Day Scheduler using third party APIs

## Description :
This is a simple a day planner Application which allows the user to save tasks for each hour in the office hours. I have created this app by modifying the starter code 
provided. Used moment.js library to include the current Day, Date and Time.

### Usage : 
- When the user opens the app it displays the current day at the top of the planner.
- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- It allows a user to enter a task when they click on a timeblock.
- Saves the task in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- Persists the added tasks between refreshes of a page.
- The timeblocks have different colors based on the time past, present or future.
